# Cab-Service-System

A Cab Service is a company that rents vehicles for a short period of time to the public. Let us create a Cab Service System project using Python in easy steps. Users who need a vehicle can rent a vehicle for a few days for less than buying a new one. It is also important for users who already have a vehicle, they can rent any vehicle for a day or so. As mentioned above, this scheme helps not only the people who need a vehicle but also the car dealers or sellers who can earn a lot of money by renting their vehicle.
